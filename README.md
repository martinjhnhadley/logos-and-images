Logos, Images and Tweets
========================

This repository contains logos, images and tweets that I regularly use in training courses and other content that I create. By creating a central repository of these things I'm hoping to reduce duplicative effort in my own work, and potentially in other's as well.

All content in this repository concerns either scripting, data visualisation, data science or reproducible research. As of 2018, the focus of the repo is on R but in the future more content covering Python will likely seep in.

tweets
------

Twitter is a an excellent source of information and humour, but keeping track of tweets is a difficult business. Until I have a better solution this repo includes two things:

-   A screenshot of the tweet
-   A link, description and categorisation of the tweet in `tweet-index.csv`

The README file in the folder provides a table of the tweets.

hex-stickers
------------

Hex stickers are awesome! There's an R library for creating them and it's really good <https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker>.

This folder contains hexstickers for the tidyverse and other libraries as well.

### Tweets

The ownership of tweets, particularly the issue of copyright infringement, is a complicated business. Despite it not having any legal weight to it, I would like to make clear: *all rights belong to their respective copyright holders*.
